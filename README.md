### Project Overview  
This repository is created for our Software Engineering group project. At this stage, we are outlining potential project directions and documenting our initial ideas.  

---

### TL;DR  
We’ve proposed three project ideas so far:  
1. **TaylorMade** – An intelligent resume and cover letter tailoring tool that adapts applications to specific job descriptions using ATS optimization.  
2. **DateQR** – A privacy-first compatibility app that connects people through QR codes.  
3. **PulseNYC** – A live culture app that connects users with street performances and pop-up events happening across New York City.  

One of these ideas will be developed further into our final project.
